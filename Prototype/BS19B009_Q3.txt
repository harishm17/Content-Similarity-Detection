Pharmacological management of the infection: 
Most of these treatment are to develop the human immune system. Various studies have reported that human monoclonal antibodies confer some protection against SARS. Traggiai et al. have developed an improved method for Epstein-Barr virus transformation of human B cells. This method was used to analyze the memory repertoire of a patient who recovered from SARS-CoV infection and to isolate monoclonal antibodies specific for different viral proteins. Although some of these monoclonal antibodies exhibited in vitro neutralizing activity, only one of such antibodies conferred protection in vivo in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection. 
• Chloroquine phosphate: blockade of viral entry by inhibiting glycosylation of host receptors, proteolytic processing, and endosomal acidification. Additional immunomodulatory effects through inhibition of cytokine production, autophagy, and lysosomal activity in host cells. 
• Hydroxychloroquine sulfate: hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine. 
• Lopinavir/ritonavir: it attacks as 3CL’s protease 
• Umifenovir:S protein/ACE2,membrane fusion inhibitor. But this could case allerdic reaction, gastrointestinal upset, elevated transaminases as side effects. 
• Remdesivir30-32 and favipiravir33,34: act as RNA polymerase inhibitor. But remdesivir gives elevated transaminases and kidney injury. And favipiravir gives diarrhea, elevated transaminases, reduction in neutrophil count as side effects. Remdesivir’s effectiveness is still unproven. Even the Indian government remains unconvinced about its efficacy. Five drug makers have obtained voluntary licences to manufacture remdesivir—Noida-headquartered Jubilant Life Sciences, Rawalpindi-based Ferozsons Laboratories, Mumbai’s Cipla, Hyderabad-headquartered Hetero Labs Ltd, and US pharma major Mylan. 
• Tocilizumab:IL-6 inhibition –reduction in cytokine strom. This could cause increase in upper respirator tract infection(including tuberculosis), nasopharyngitis, headache, hematologic effects and infection as side effects. First four drugs are repurposed agents, which means a strategy to use a drug designed for one particular disease in another condition. And next two are investigational agents(also antiviral drugs), a substance that has been tested in the laboratory and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing in people. Last one is adjunctive therapies, which is a drug or substance used in addition to the primary therapy. Currently we use Chloroquine/ Hydroxychloroquine in hospitals to stop covid 19. Remdesivir and Favipiravir are most effective drugs in present treatment methods. But favipiravir meet the disadvantages of remdesivir (both in side effects and social issues). so Glenmark Pharmaceuticals has already launched phase-three trials of favipiravir in India. favipiravir cannot be sold in India until phase three testing is complete, Brinton has already launched the drug for export to 18 countries. It has even shipped the first consignment.
