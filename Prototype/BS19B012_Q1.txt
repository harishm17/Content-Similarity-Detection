Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause disease in mammals and birds. They are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. SARS-CoV-2 is a Betacoronavirus that causes a respiratory illness in humans. COVID-19 is a contagious disease and caused the designation of the pandemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization.
Structure
SARS-CoV-2 virus is roughly spherical with 50-200 nm in diameter. It contains four structural proteins, namely envelope(E), spike(S), membrane(M), and nucleocapsid(N) proteins. The virus contains a lipid bilayer in which the M, E, S structural proteins are present. The M protein is the most abundant, mostly responsible for the shape of the envelope. The E protein is the smallest structural protein. The spike protein is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach and fuse with the membrane of the host cell. Spike glycoprotein binds to the human ACE2 receptor present in the target cells in the respiratory tract. This protein has a compact ridge that allows the virus to attach more strongly than other viruses of the same origin. After the spike protein binds with the receptor in the target cell, the viral envelope fuses with the cell membrane and releases the viral genome into the target cell. Inside the envelope there is the nucleocapsid which is formed with multiple copies of the nucleocapsid protein in association with the RNA.
