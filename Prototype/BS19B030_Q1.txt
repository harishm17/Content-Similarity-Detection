INTRODUCTION 
COVID-19 a respiratory disease caused by virus of coronavirus family(beta-coronavirus) named as SARS CoV-2. SARS CoV-2 is a successor of SARS CoV which also appeared in China between 2002-04. Corona virus received their name from their appearance in electron micrographs where spike like protrusions on the surface of protein created an effect like corona(Latin for spikes). The genetic material inside corona is single stranded RNA and entire genome is almost 30k bases long packed together with Nucleocapsid protein for virus. To replicate it has to put it’s RNA into the cell and hijack the cellular machinery to produce new viruses 
STRUCTURE 
• It’s spherical in shape with a diameter ranging from 50-200 nm. 
• It has four structural proteins namely spike protein(S)* , envelope protein(E)*, membrane protein* (M) and nucleo protein(N)* 
• HEMAGG glycoprotein forms a second type of spike, smaller than the spike protein , on the envelopes of group II(betacoronavirus) coronaviruses. HE displays hemagglutinating and esterase activities Coronavirus HE proteins have not received much attention in the past, probably because they are nonessential for replication in tissue culture 
S-Protein structure: It has an a-helical coiled-coil structure, which contain in their C-terminal part regions predicted to have an a-helical secondary structure and to form coiled-coils. The S2 subunit is the most conserved region of the protein, whereas the S1 subunit diverges in sequence even among species of a single coronavirus . The S1 contains two subdomains, a N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD). Both are able to function as receptor binding domains (RBDs) and bind variety of proteins and sugars. 
E-Protein structure: The CoV E protein is a short, integral membrane protein of 76–109 amino acids, ranging from 8.4 to 12 kDa in size . The primary and secondary structure reveals that E has a short, hydrophilic amino terminus consisting of 7–12 amino acids, followed by a large hydrophobic transmembrane domain (TMD) of 25 amino acids, and ends with a long, hydrophilic carboxyl terminus, which comprises the majority of the protein 
M-Protein Structure: Not much info available on structure of M-Protein 
N-Protein: Amino acid sequence comparisons have shown that CoV N proteins have three distinct and highly conserved domains: two structural and independently folded structural regions, namely the N terminal domain, and C-terminal domain , which are separated by a intrinsically disordered central region; all three domains have been shown in different CoVs to bind with viral RNA
