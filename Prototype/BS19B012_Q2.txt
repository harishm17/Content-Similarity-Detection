Viral Entry into Human cell
Coronaviruses enter host cells by first, binding to a cell surface receptor for viral attachment. Subsequently they enter the endosomes and eventually fuse viral and lysosomal membranes. The surface-anchored spike protein mediate the virus entry. SARS-CoV-2 spike binds to its receptor human ACE2 through its receptor-binding domain and is activated by human proteases. The respiratory track contains lots of ACE2 receptors making it the primary colony for the virus. Its cell entry is preactivated by furin which reduces its dependence on cell proteases. Proteases are capable of hydrolyzing peptide bonds in proteins. The host cell serine protease TMPRSS2 primes the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 for entry. The S protein has two domains (parts) in it—the S1 and the S2 and both of them have specified functions that work in the viral entry to the host cell. The S1 domain functions to cling to the typical receptor, while the S2 domain helps in fusion with the membrane of the host cell. Now, to be effective, the S protein needs to be cleaved for the separation of S1 and S2 domains. The TMPRSS2 protein present in the host cell (human cell) does this cleaving. This makes the TMPRSS2 protein an essential ingredient in the viral entry to the host cell. Once inside the cell, viral polyproteins are synthesized that encode for the replicase-transcriptase complex. The virus then synthesizes RNA via its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Structural proteins are synthesized leading to completion of assembly and release of viral particles.
