Structural features of COVID-19:
COVID - 19 is a spherical containing single-stranded RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix protein. The envelope bears club-shaped glycoprotein projections. Some coronaviruses also contain a hem agglutinin-esterase protein Coronaviruses possess the largest genomes among all known RNA viruses, with G + C contents varying from 32% to 43%. Variable numbers of small ORFs are present between the various conserved genes and, downstream to the nucleocapsid gene in different coronavirus lineages. The viral genome contains distinctive features, including a unique N-terminal fragment within the spike protein. Genes for the major structural proteins in all coronaviruses occur in the 5'–3' order as S, E, M, and N.
A typical CoV contains at least six ORFs in its genome. ORF1a and ORF1b contain a frameshift in between which produces two polypeptides: pp1a and pp1ab. These polypeptides are processed by virally encoded chymotrypsin-like protease or main protease and one or two papain-like protease into 16 nsps. All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs. Four main structural proteins contain spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins are encoded by ORFs 10, 11 on the one-third of the genome near the 3'-terminus. Besides these four main structural proteins, different CoVs encode special structural and accessory proteins, such as HE protein, 3a/b protein, and 4a/b protein. These mature proteins are responsible for several important functions in genome maintenance and virus replication.
