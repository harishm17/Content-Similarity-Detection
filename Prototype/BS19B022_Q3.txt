Current pharmacological management of the pandemic virus There is no exact cure for the virus as of yet, although several drugs and pre-existing compounds have shown promising results, apart from severe side-effects. Several potential vaccines are being developed in different parts of the world. Some have reached human trials as well. Below are some of the important drugs that have shown effective results: Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine 
Chloroquine, an anti-malarial medication, is being used as a line of treatment for COVID-19 cases. However, the drug has not been formally approved through clinical trials in the United States The experimental treatment is authorized only for emergency use for patients who are hospitalized but are not able to receive treatment in a clinical trial. 
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have numerous, potentially serious, side-effects, such as retinopathy, hypoglycaemia, or life-threatening arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy. Some people have allergic reactions to these drugs. Favipiravir 
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show that favipiravir was clearly effective. Of 35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a median of 4 days, while the length of illness was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive it. Remdesivir 
It is specifically an adenosine analogue which inserts into viral RNA chains, causing premature breaking of the chains. Clinical trials conducted in China, did not find remdesivir to be effective in reducing the time for improvement from COVID-19 infections or deaths, and caused various adverse effects in the remdesivir- treated participants. 
A number of vaccines, being developed, have shown promising results. Some of them are: 
1. Adenovirus type 5 vectored COVID-19 (Ad5-nCoV) vaccine 2. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 3. BNT162, INO-4800, etc.
