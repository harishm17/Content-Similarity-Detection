Entry of the virus into human cell:
The inhaled virus SARS-CoV-2 likely binds to epithelial cells in the nasal cavity and starts replicating. ACE2 is the main receptor for both SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV. In vitro data with SARS-CoV indicate that the ciliated cells are primary cells infected in the conducting airways. However, since single-cell RNA indicates low level of ACE2 expression in conducting airway cells and no obvious cell type preference. There is local propagation of the virus but a limited innate immune response. At this stage the virus can be detected by nasal swabs. Although the viral burden may be low, these individuals are infectious. The RT-PCR value for the viral RNA might be useful to predict the viral load and the subsequent infectivity and clinical course. Nasal swabs might be more sensitive than throat swabs.
The virus propagates and migrates down the respiratory tract along the conducting airways, and a more robust innate immune response is triggered. Nasal swabs should yield the virus (SARS-CoV-2) as well as early markers of the innate immune response. At this time, the disease COVID-19 is clinically manifest. Viral infected epithelial cells are a major source of beta and lambda interferons. In conclusion, COVID-19 confined to the conducting airways should be mild and treated symptomatically at home. However, COVID-19 that has progressed to the gas exchange units of the lung must be monitored carefully and supported to the best of our ability, as we await the development and testing of specific antiviral drugs.
