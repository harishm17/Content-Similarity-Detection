Pharmacological management of the infection 
Coronavirus can cause animal intestinal infection or human respiratory tract infection.The process 
of virus infection requires the participation of receptors on the surface of the host cell 
membrane.The S protein on the surface of coronavirus can recognize and bind to the host cell 
through clathrin mediated endocytosis. Different coronaviruses can use different cell receptor of 
aminopeptidase N. It has been indicated that aminopeptidase N and DPP4 slight respiratory 
symptoms. SARS-CoV and MERS, respectively. Both caused outbreks with severe symptoms and 
a high mortality. People are generally susceptible to SARS-COV-2, with an average of 3-4 days.
