Signs and symptoms 
Presentations of COVID-19 have ranged from asymptomatic/mild symptoms to severe illness and mortality. Symptoms may develop 2 days to 2 weeks following exposure to the virus. A pooled analysis of 181 confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside Wuhan, China, found the mean incubation period to be 5.1 
days and that 97.5% of individuals who developed symptoms did so within 11.5 days of infection. 
Wu and McGoogan reported that, among 72,314 COVID-19 cases reported to the Chinese Center for disease Control and Prevention (CCDC), 81% were mild (absent or mild pneumonia), 14% were severe (hypoxia, dyspnea, >50% lung involvement within 24-48 hours), 5% were critical (shock, respiratory failure, multiorgan dysfunction), and 2.3% were fatal. 
Cough and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing plus at least two of the following symptoms may indicate COVID-19: 
Fever 
Chills 
Repeated shaking with chills 
Muscle pain 
Headache 
Sore throat 
New loss of taste or smell 
Other reported symptoms have included the following: 
Fatigue 
Sputum production 
Diarrhea 
Malaise 
Respiratory distress 
The most common serious manifestation of COVID-19 appears to be pneumonia. 
A complete or partial loss of the sense of smell (anosmia) has been reported as a potential history finding in patients eventually diagnosed with COVID-19. A phone survey of outpatients with mildly symptomatic COVID-19 found that 64.4% (130 of 202) reported any altered sense of smell or taste. 
Symptoms in children with infection appear to be uncommon, although some children with severe COVID-19 have been reported.
