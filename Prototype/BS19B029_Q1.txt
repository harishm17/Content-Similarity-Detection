Structural Features of Covid-19 Virus 
• Coronaviruses are large, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses. The virus is positive- stranded meaning that they have a "sense" strand of RNA (coded information about how to build proteins) as their genetic material. 
• The genome is packed inside a helical capsid formed by the nucleocapsid protein and further surrounded by an envelope. A capsid is the protein shell of a virus, enclosing genetic material. In positive-stranded RNA viruses, with 5’-cap structure and 3’-poly-A-tail, helical capsids are typically composed of many identical subunits of the viral capsid protein, encapsulating a molecule of viral genomic RNA. 
• The main structural proteins that are associated with the envelope are: 1. The membrane protein(M) has three transmembrane domains, promotes membrane 
curvature and binds to the nucleocapsid. 2. The envelope protein(E) plays a role in virus assembly and release and is involved in viral 
pathogenesis. 3. The nucleocapsid protein(N) contains two domains, both of which can bind virus RNA 
genomes through different mechanisms. 4. The spike protein which mediates virus entry into host cells. 
• Among these structural proteins, the spike forms large protrusions from the virus surface, giving coronaviruses the appearance of having crowns. 
• Researchers have found that the covid-19 spike protein was 10 to 20 times more likely to bind ACE2 on human cells than the spike from the SARS virus from 2002. This may enable covid-19 to spread more easily from person to person than the earlier virus. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to the same human receptor, known as ACE2. They found that a few genetic mutations led the SARS-CoV-2's spike protein to develop a more compact molecular "ridge" than that of SARS-CoV. This more compact structure, and several other small differences, allows SARS-CoV-2 to attach more strongly to the human ACE2 receptor, thereby enabling it to better infect cells and thus spread faster than the SARS coronavirus.
