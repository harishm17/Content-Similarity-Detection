#### All files related to the prototype

Use basic cosine similarity and preprocessing for prototype...as its not as hard as suffix trees so we can do it in time

Do it to every possible pair of documents for now..we can improve later

we can decide on a threshold similarity measure and check which ones are similar and which ones are not..and maybe group them
